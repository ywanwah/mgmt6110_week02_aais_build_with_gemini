# PROMPTS.md - [AI Prompt Log: Singapore CPI Dashboard Integration]
**Student:** [Jo Yeong Wan Wah] · **Course:** MGMT 6110 · **Problem Set 2**
**User sentence:** A user opens this screen to the Singapore CPI Dashboard Integration, and knows it worked when they see a fully dynamic, real-time chart or metric displaying the latest Singapore Consumer Price Index (CPI) data fetched from the official SingStat API, alongside a clear attribution footnote in the footer, without any hardcoded mock data.

## 1. Initial System Prompt
**Intent:** Establish the serverless project architecture, error guardrails, and Vercel environment constraints.

```text
[Pasted the full initial prompt here: "ROLE: You are a senior full-stack developer... CONTEXT: Deployed on Vercel from GitHub..."]
```
**Outcome:** The AI generated the initial structure for `api/cpi.js` and `api/health.js`, and advised setting up the `SINGSTAT_API_KEY` environment variable.

## 2. Failed Prompts & Debugging Cycles

### Cycle A: Environment Variable & Vercel Prefix Clarification
*   **Intent:** Identify the correct environment variable naming strategy to pass the prompt's backend guardrail.
*   **Context:** The SingStat Table Builder API is publicly accessible, but the prompt mandates an upstream credential check to protect project architecture. 
*   **Debugging Query:** *“What is the Environment Variable in Vercel for the above prompts?”*
*   **Outcome:** Established `SINGSTAT_API_KEY` as a required Vercel environment variable using placeholder content (`public_access`). The AI highlighted a critical security risk: **never prefix the variable with `VITE_`** (`VITE_SINGSTAT_API_KEY`), as doing so forces Vite to compile the variable directly into the client-side browser bundle, violating the strict backend isolation guardrail.

### Cycle B: HTML Response Parsing Failure
*   **Intent:** Resolve the network failure crash when the upstream server goes down.
*   **The Error Encountered:**
    ```text
    The SingStat service is currently unreachable due to a network connection failure.
    Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
    ```
*   **Debugging Query:** *“I am getting an error when testing: 'Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON'. The SingStat service is failing or returning an HTML error page. Update the serverless functions to handle this without crashing.”*
*   **Outcome:** The AI updated the route logic by adding an explicit check for `response.ok` before parsing `.json()`, successfully intercepting the HTML error payload and transforming it into a clean `502 Upstream Unreachable` JSON payload.

## 3. Manual Refinements (Hand-Coding)
*   **Timestamp/Phase:** Post-generation cleanup.
*   **Action Taken:** Manually verified that the environment variable checking block in `api/cpi.js` correctly evaluates both missing values and the string literal `"undefined"` to align perfectly with Vercel's preview deployment behavior.
